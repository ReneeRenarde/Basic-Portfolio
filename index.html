        <p><b>Hello, is it me you're looking for?</b></p>
        <p>
            If you look up about two inches, you'll see my name is Anne Jordan. And if you spend any amount of time on this website, you'll see that it's not
            the cleanest looking of webpages. That's because I've designed most of this site using html and css. I did spend an immense amount of time on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools!</a>
            so I have a number of lines borrowed from that amazing resource. I don't have this coding thing figured out yet as I'm just barely scratching the surface... 
        </p>
        <p><b>Why am I learning coding you ask?</b></p>
        <p>
            Well, because I think it's really fun. I also think everyone has an ethical obligation to learn coding, the more diverse people we have coding, the better scenarios we can 
            code for. It's also a useful skill to have if you decide you want to, like, make some money on the side or something... Oh, you didn't ask why I wanted to learn coding?
        </p>
      
        <p><b>Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but then who'd look around this awesome website?</b></p>
